This tool is designed to automate the process of generating documentation for a codebase and database tables, as well as objects like triggers and functions. It utilizes OpenAI API and GPT-4 technology to generate detailed documentation, which is then compiled into a static website.

The tool is run from the command line and can take several hours to complete, depending on the size and complexity of the codebase and database being documented. Once completed, the static website can be easily accessed and shared among team members, stakeholders, and other interested parties.

The generated documentation includes information such as function and class definitions, variable descriptions, database table structures, trigger and function details, and more. It is designed to be comprehensive and informative, making it easier for developers and other users to understand and work with the codebase and database.

By automating the documentation process, this tool saves valuable time and resources that would otherwise be spent manually creating and updating documentation. It also ensures consistency and accuracy in the documentation, reducing the risk of errors and misunderstandings.

Overall, the Codebase and Database Documentation Generator Tool is a powerful and useful tool for any organization that wants to streamline its documentation process and improve the accessibility and understanding of its codebase and datab
