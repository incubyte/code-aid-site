# ItemizedReportHelper.R
# Overview

This script extracts, transforms, and loads data from MeasureOne API, and generates reports for the given data in the XLSX format. These reports contain details about individual transactions and are encrypted using passwords specified in a customer data table (DTcusf). The script primarily consists of multiple functions, each performing specific operations, and finally using the `fnMakeFiles` function to create and store the files.

## Function: fnGetbyid

This function retrieves individual details from the MeasureOne API using a given Individual ID (ind_id). The function sends a POST request to the API and processes the returned data into a data table with relevant fields.

### Inputs:

1. ind_id - A string containing the individual ID for which details need to be fetched.

### Outputs:

1. tmpDf - A data table containing individual details such as status code, first name, last name, external ID, and email ID.

## Function: fnCk

This function checks if an input value (x) is an empty list, and returns an empty string if true, otherwise, it returns the first element of the list.

### Inputs:

1. x - An input value (list).
2. idx - An index value (default: 1).

### Outputs:

1. '' - Empty string if x is an empty list.
2. x[[idx]] - The first element of the list if x is not an empty list.

## Function: fnGetByIdS

This function retrieves individual details for a set of individual IDs.

### Inputs:

1. id_vec - A vector of individual IDs.

### Outputs:

1. An aggregated data table containing individual details for each individual ID.

## Function: fnCreateItemizedReport

This function generates an itemized report in an XLSX file format. This function accepts a data table (DT1) and a file name (filename) as inputs, formats the data table, and writes the resulting table to an XLSX file.

## Function: fnGetSkuLastMonth

This function filters a given data set (lsM1) to retrieve only those records that satisfy certain criteria, such as delivered items and a specific date range. The resulting data table contains individual details as well.

## Function: fnPrepIR

This function prepares a data table (DT1) for generating an itemized report by renaming columns, sorting records, and adding a count column.

## Function: fnMakeFile

This function aggregates, filters, and formats data from the given data tables to generate an itemized report and saves it as an XLSX file.

## Function: fnMakeFiles

This function is used to create encrypted ZIP files from the XLSX files generated by running the `fnMakeFile` function. It accepts a customer data table and a data table containing SKU data.

# Risks

## Security Issues

1. Passwords are stored in plain text in the customer data table (DTcusf). This could expose passwords to unauthorized users.

## Bugs

No bugs found.

# Refactoring Opportunities

1. Move common operations and settings into sub-functions that can be reused. This would make it easier to maintain and modify the code.
2. Use `lapply()` and vapply with a more informative name rather than the general `ls`.
3. Consolidate `paste0()` with a single call to `paste()` using `sep=""`, which would make the string manipulation more readable.
4. Replace the for loop in `fnMakeFiles` with a `lapply()` function for better readability and performance.
