## Overview

The `net.glowstone.chunk.SectionPosition` package contains a single class called `SectionPosition`. This class is used for representing and handling positions in a three-dimensional (x, y, z) chunk section. It also provides utility functions to convert a position from a long-encoded format to a `SectionPosition` object and vice versa.

### SectionPosition

This class is marked with the `@Data` annotation provided by Lombok, which automatically generates getter, setter, toString, equals, and hashCode methods for each field.

The `SectionPosition` class has three fields: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are the three coordinates of the position in a chunk section. Each field has a private access modifier and is marked final, meaning that it cannot be changed after the object has been created.

#### Function: fromLong(long encoded)

1. This method takes in a `long` value `encoded` which represents the position of a chunk section in a long-encoded format.
2. The method calculates `sectionX`, `sectionY`, and `sectionZ` by applying bitwise operations on `encoded`. The operations performed involve a combination of bit-shifts and bit-mask operations.
3. It creates and returns a new instance of the `SectionPosition` class using the calculated `sectionX`, `sectionY`, and `sectionZ` values.

#### Function: asLong()

1. This method performs the opposite of `fromLong()`. It encodes the three coordinate fields `x`, `y`, and `z` into a `long` value.
2. First, bitwise operations are applied on each of the coordinates with the corresponding masks: `x & 0x3FFFFF`, `y & 0xFFFFF`, and `z & 0x3FFFFF`.
3. The individual masked values are then bitwise shifted and combined using the OR `|` operator.
4. The resulting `long` value is returned.

        return new SectionPosition(sectionX, sectionY, sectionZ);
    }

    public long asLong() {
        return ((x & 0x3FFFFF) << 42) | (y & 0xFFFFF) | ((z & 0x3FFFFF) << 20);
    }
}
