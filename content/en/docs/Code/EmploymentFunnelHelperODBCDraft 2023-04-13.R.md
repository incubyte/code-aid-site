# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13.R
# Overview

The code provided handles a series of functions for data manipulation and extraction from different sources. It covers generic functions for handling operations such as aggregation, merging, and joining of data based on specified parameters. There are functions specific to handling data extraction from Mixpanel API, as well as utility functions for processing returned data.

# Generic Functions

1. **fnRecursivelyJoin**: This function is designed to join a base data.table (dtBase) with multiple data.tables (ls) recursively based on common key columns. It handles different lengths of the list (ls) and joins data.tables one by one. In addition, it fills missing data with 0 for the joined data.

2. **fnDailyVolumes**: Given an input data.table (dtSkus) and an interval (ntrv), this function calculates daily activity volumes and provides summary statistics. It filters the data based on specified dates and service codes, aggregates the data, replaces missing values with 0, and produces a final data.table as the result.

3. **fnSamCol**: The function combines dt1 and dt2, returning the common column names.

4. **getNwordVec** and **getNword**: These functions extract random words from a given wordList. getNwordVec extracts N number of random words from the list, while getNword extracts only the specified number of words from the list.

5. **fnMergeList**: This function recursively merges a list of data.tables (LSDT) based on the key vector (keyvec).

6. **fnFillNA**: This function fills NA values in the provided vector (vec) with the previous value in the vector.

7. **fnPrint1**: This function prints column values for a given data.table (DT) and row number (iii).

8. **is.date and fnFindDates**: These functions help in checking if an object is POSIXct and finding column names containing date values in a data.table (DT).

9. **fnDateChange**: This function changes the formatting of the date columns in a data.table (DT).

10. **fnComb**: Combines data.tables recursively based on a given set of columns (cols).

11. **fnJoin**: Joins two data.tables, DT1 and DT2, with an option for left join, left variable names, key vector, etc.

12. **fnSelfLink**: Creates a self-linked data.table based on specified columns.

13. **fnExclude**: Excludes columns from a given data.table based on a vector of column names (cvec).

14. **fnCreateSankeyData**: Creates a Sankey Data representation from a given data.table.

# Mixpanel Specific Elements

15. **fld_nam**: A vector of field names.

16. **fn_mixpanel_raw_export**: Function to fetch data from Mixpanel API. It takes the date range and keyBearer as inputs and returns the fetched data.

17. **fnCoalesce**: Coalesces two data sources based on a given column.

18. **mxDTprepJson**: Takes a JSON string as input and formats it to a suitable data.frame or data.table.

19. **fnFix5b**: A function that handles NULL values in the input list and applies the required conversion.

# Risks

## Security Issues

1. When passing keyBearer for the API calls, it is better to use a secure method like environment variables instead of hard coding it into the function.

## Bugs

There are no known bugs at this time.

# Refactoring Opportunities

1. Reduce the usage of global variables and input them as function parameters or encapsulate the code within a class.

2. Break down complex functions into smaller sub-functions to enable easier testing and debugging.

3. The comments can be more descriptive and elaborate on the role of the function and its parameters.

4. Follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions.

5. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle can be followed more strictly by eliminating repeated functionality and reusing functions. This will help in reducing the code size and making the script more modular.
