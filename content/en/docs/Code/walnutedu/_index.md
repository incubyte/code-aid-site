Source Control
{{</sectionHeadingWithTooltip>}}

{{< customCheckBox "Version control system (VCS) used: UNKNOWN" >}}

{{< /customCheckBox>}}{{<whyItMatters>}}
Source control, also known as version control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Source control systems provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources. They also provide the ability to revert to previous versions, which can be crucial for finding the source of bugs or undoing changes. Git, Mercurial, and Subversion are examples of popular source control systems.

- **Version Tracking:** A source control system helps keep track of changes in your code over time. This helps you to effectively collaborate with others and allows you to revert back to a previous state if necessary.
- **Collaboration:** Source control systems play a vital role in team-based software development. It provides a structured way for developers to share, modify, and distribute code efficiently.
- **Backup and Restore:** Source control systems also serve as a form of backup. If your local files are accidentally deleted or modified, you can restore them from the version control system.

###### Quick Start:
Consider using Git as a starting point for version control in your project. Include a `.git` directory in your project to start tracking changes with Git. [Learn more in this Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).

{{<sectionHeadingWithTooltip "Our system determines the build tool used by your project by looking for specific configuration files in the root directory. For instance, pom.xml indicates Maven, build.gradle or build.gradle.kts points to Gradle (with Kotlin in the latter case), package.json implies npm, and so forth. If none of these files are found, the build tool will be marked as unknown.">}}
Build Tools
{{</sectionHeadingWithTooltip>}}

{{< customCheckBox "Build tools used: UNKNOWN" >}}

{{< /customCheckBox>}}{{<whyItMatters>}}
Build tools are a set of programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code. Building incorporates compiling, linking, and packaging the code into a usable or executable form. Essentially, build tools take care of the process that transforms your source code into a version of the software that can be executed. Examples of build tools include Maven, Gradle, and npm.

###### Why it matters:
- **Standardization and Automation:** Build tools help standardize the process of building, testing, and deploying software. They can automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and increase productivity.
- **Dependency Management:** Build tools handle dependencies for you, making sure that the correct versions of libraries and frameworks are used.
- **Integration:** Build tools often integrate with testing frameworks and deployment tools, facilitating continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

###### Quick Start:
Consider using Maven (for Java projects) or npm (for JavaScript projects) as a starting point. These tools will help you automate your build processes and manage dependencies effectively. Learn more in the [Maven Getting Started Guide](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html) or [npm Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

Containerization
{{</sectionHeadingWithTooltip>}}

{{< customCheckBox "Containerization tool used: UNKNOWN" >}}

{{< /customCheckBox>}}{{<whyItMatters>}}
Containerization is the process of packaging an application along with its required environment, libraries, and dependencies, all bundled into one package or "container". This container can then be run consistently on any infrastructure, which provides advantages in terms of portability, consistency, and efficiency. Docker and Kubernetes are popular tools used for containerization.

- **Consistency:** Containerization ensures that your application runs the same way, every time, regardless of the environment. This eliminates the common problem of "it works on my machine".
- **Scalability:** Containerized applications are easy to scale. Just spin up a new container when you need more capacity.
- **Isolation:** Containers isolate your application and its dependencies from the rest of the system. This reduces conflicts between different parts of your system and increases security.

###### Quick Start:
Docker is the most popular tool for containerization. Get started by creating a Dockerfile to specify how your application should run. Learn more with the [Docker getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

{{<sectionHeadingWithTooltip "We identify the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tool used in your project by searching for specific configuration files in the root directory. For example, a Jenkinsfile suggests Jenkins, .gitlab-ci.yml suggests GitLab CI, .travis.yml indicates Travis CI, and so on. If none of these files are found, the CI/CD tool will be listed as unknown">}}
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
{{</sectionHeadingWithTooltip>}}

{{< customCheckBox "CI/CD configuration present: UNKNOWN" >}}

{{< /customCheckBox>}}{{<whyItMatters>}}
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools are a crucial part of modern software development practices. These tools automate the steps in the software release process, such as integration, testing, and deployment. By using CI/CD tools, developers can frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests are run. Popular CI/CD tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD.

- **Automated Testing and Deployment:** CI/CD tools automate the process of testing and deploying your code. This reduces the risk of human error, and ensures that your application is always running the latest, most stable version of your code.
- **Rapid Feedback:** With CI/CD, you get rapid feedback on any changes you make. If a change breaks something, you'll know immediately, and can fix the issue before it reaches the production environment.
- **Improved Collaboration:** CI/CD tools help teams work together more efficiently. Since all changes are tested and deployed automatically, teams can focus on writing great code, rather than manually managing the release process.

###### Quick Start:
Jenkins is a popular open-source CI/CD tool that's worth considering. It's highly customizable and supports a wide range of plugins. Get started with [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/getting-started/) to automate your build, test, and deployment processes.

{{<sectionHeadingWithTooltip "This service looks for the presence of tests in your codebase by scanning for file patterns that typically denote tests. Common patterns include names containing 'Test', 'test', 'Spec', 'spec', 'Should', 'should' and so on. These patterns are sought in all directories of your project. If such files are detected, it indicates that your project likely has a testing mechanism in place.">}}
Testing
{{</sectionHeadingWithTooltip>}}

{{< customCheckBox "Testing" >}}

{{< /customCheckBox>}}{{<whyItMatters>}}
Software testing is the process of evaluating a software item to detect differences between given input and expected output. Testing assesses the quality of the product and ensures that the software is error-free, reliable, and performs effectively. It can be automated or carried out manually and can be as simple as a few lines of code or as complex as a suite of extensive programs.

- **Quality Assurance:** Testing helps ensure that your code functions as expected, and catches bugs or errors before they reach production.
- **Refactoring Confidence:** With a good test suite, you can refactor or add features with the confidence that you haven't inadvertently broken existing functionality.
- **Documentation:** Tests can serve as documentation by clearly showing what functionality is expected from the code.

###### Quick Start:
Different languages and frameworks often have their own set of testing tools. For example, JUnit for Java, pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript, etc. Consider setting up unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to have a comprehensive testing strategy. Explore the testing tools and libraries for your specific language or framework to get started.

{{<sectionHeadingWithTooltip "We look for migration scripts in your project by searching for specific file patterns within your codebase. Common patterns include directories labeled 'migrations', 'Migrations', 'EFMigrations', or 'DbMigrations', and files with names ending in 'Migration' with various language-specific file extensions like '.java', '.py', '.rb', '.js', '.php', '.go', '.r', or '.cob'. If files matching these patterns are found, we consider that your project uses migration scripts">}}
Database Migrations
{{</sectionHeadingWithTooltip>}}

{{< customCheckBox "Database migration scripts present" >}}

{{< /customCheckBox>}}{{<whyItMatters>}}
Database migration scripts are sets of commands that bring your database from one state to another. These scripts, often written in SQL or a similar database language, update the schema of your database or change the data within it. Migration scripts can be thought of as version control for your database, allowing you to update, rollback, and manage your database schema effectively. They are an integral part of database management and are widely used in software development.

- **Version Control:** Database migration scripts allow you to version control your database changes just like your application code. This is essential for consistency across environments.
- **Collaboration:** Migration scripts enable multiple developers to collaborate on database changes without overwriting each other's work.
- **Rollbacks:** In case of a problem, migration scripts allow you to roll back database changes to a previous state.

###### Quick Start:
Various database migration tools are available based on the technology you are using. For example, you could use Flyway or Liquibase for Java, FluentMigrator for .NET, or Alembic for Python. Read the documentation of your preferred tool to get started.
{{</whyItMatters>}}


{{<sectionHeadingWithTooltip "Our system searches for schema definitions within your project by looking for specific file patterns in your codebase. Common patterns include files with 'Schema', 'schema', 'model', 'Model', 'Entity' in their names. These patterns could exist at any level of your project directories. If files matching these patterns are detected, it signifies that your project likely has defined data schemas.">}}
Database Schema Documentation
{{</sectionHeadingWithTooltip>}}

{{< customCheckBox "Database schema documentation present" >}}

{{< /customCheckBox>}}{{<whyItMatters>}}
A database schema is a blueprint or structure that represents the logical configuration of the entire database. It defines how data is organized and how relationships are enforced in the data. The schema lays out the tables, fields, relationships, indexes, and views of the database. It is essential in determining how data is stored, organized, and manipulated.

- **Data Integrity:** Defining a schema for your database helps to ensure data integrity by imposing rules on the data being inserted.
- **Efficient Queries:** A well-defined schema can make queries more efficient and easier to write.
- **Clear Structure:** A schema provides a clear structure of the database, making it easier to understand the data and how it relates to other data.

###### Quick Start:
Most database systems have tools or language features for defining schemas. For example, SQL-based systems often use DDL (Data Definition Language) commands to create and modify schemas. NoSQL databases like MongoDB allow you to define schemas using JavaScript-like syntax. Look into the documentation of your database system to learn more about defining schemas.
