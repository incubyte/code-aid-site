# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-A.R
# Overview

This script contains multiple functions that work with JSON files, data extraction, transformation, and loading of data. It also includes functions to extract data from PostgreSQL and process it further. Below is a detailed explanation of each function with the intent to provide a better understanding of their functionality and relationships.

## Function: `nm_response0`

This function is responsible for extracting the names, values, and class information from any JSON data.

1. Inputs: `json_act_data`
2. Process: 
    a. Get names from JSON data.
    b. Iterate through each item, extract value and class information, and store it in a data table.
    c. If an item in JSON has nested lists, use recursion to extract the required information from the nested list.
3. Outputs: Returns extracted data in a data table.

## Function: `nm_response1`

This function works with JSON data and processes several date-time columns.

1. Inputs: `json_act_data`, `echo`(optional for displaying the output)
2. Process: 
    a. Iterate through each item in JSON data.
    b. Extract metric columns and apply date-time transformations.
3. Outputs: Returns a data table with transformed dates.

## Function: `fnDeliver`

This function works with the input JSON file to extract information such utility as string operations, date-time transformations, etc.

1. Inputs: `json_act_data`
2. Process:
    a. Iterate through each item in JSON data.
    b. Extract utility information and apply date-time transformations.
3. Outputs: Returns a data table with updated data.

## Function: `fnGetPostgresData`

This function connects to a PostgreSQL database, extracts data using multiple SQL queries, and processes the extracted data.

1. Inputs: `start_date`, `username`, `pwd`, `echo`(optional)
2. Process:
    a. Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL server.
    b. Execute SQL queries to extract data (e.g., customer tokens, SKU data, invites data, funnel data, etc.).
    c. Disconnect from the PostgreSQL server.
3. Outputs: Returns a list containing multiple data tables.

## Function: `fnGetPostgresData2`

This function connects to a PostgreSQL database, extracts specific data related to M1 Plaid transactions, and processes the extracted data.

1. Inputs: `start_date`, `username`, `pwd`, `echo`(optional)
2. Process:
    a. Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL server.
    b. Execute an SQL query to extract M1 Plaid transactions data.
    c. Disconnect from the PostgreSQL server.
3. Outputs: Returns a data table containing M1 Plaid transactions data.

# Risks

## Security issues

- The script contains hard-coded information such as server addresses, which could lead to unauthorized access.
- Sensitive data like passwords and user IDs are being stored in the environment variables without any proper data protection or encryption, which poses a security risk.

## Bugs

- Although necessary checks are implemented for some input scenarios, edge cases and exceptions may exist that could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

# Refactoring opportunities

1. The connection logic used in `fnGetPostgresData` and `fnGetPostgresData2` is repetitive and could be placed inside a separate function to avoid redundancy and improve code reusability.
2. Date-time transformations are used quite frequently in various functions. It is advisable to create a separate helper function for date-time transformations that can be invoked when required.
3. There are functions with similar or overlapping functionality (`nm_response0`, `nm_response1`, and `fnDeliver`). These functions could be combined or refactored to utilize a more modular approach.
4. The script uses a mix of different libraries such as `odbc`, `dbConnect` â€” which can be standardized to make the codebase consistent and easier to maintain.+++

# Function Explanations

## 1. nm_response0

This function extracts column names from a JSON object and returns a nested data.table object.

### Input:

- json_act_data: JSON object

### Output:

- ls: data.table object

## 2. nm_response1

This function
