# EmploymentFunnel 2023-04-08-2.R
## Overview

The code in question performs various data extraction and transformation operations and reads/writes data from different sources like files and APIs. The main purpose of the script is to process the data and generate statistics or extract specific information to be used in further analysis.

In the following sections, we will go through each part of the code and provide explanations for important functions and data operations.

## Data extraction & filtering

1. Extract data from various sources:

   - `DTcustnw`, `mgOut`, `dt_efuse`, `lsM1`, `DT_delv`, `DT_msg`, `dtSkus`, `DTmx2`, `mgOutNTA`, `DTmx3`.
   
   - Data is also extracted from various API calls such as `updateDataCio()`.

2. Filtering and processing data based on conditions:

   - Filter data by specific dates, e.g. `mgOut[rff_created_at>'2023/01/01',.N,by=c('act_id','customer_name')]`.

   - Aggregate data and count by certain fields, e.g. `dt_efuse[,.N,by=c('sku_status')]`.

## Data transformation

1. Compute various statistics and aggregations, e.g. counting the number of records by specific fields or calculating the average of certain columns.

2. Create various data tables and data frames by filtering and processing the extracted data.

3. Use various helper functions such as `fnGetByIdS`, `fnSetFlag`, and `fnJoin` to aid in data manipulation and processing.

## Risks

### Security issues

- The code might not handle authentication or access control properly when dealing with APIs and sensitive data. Credentials and tokens should be stored securely and not embedded within the script.

### Bugs

- The code might produce incorrect results if the input data formats change unexpectedly. Proper validation and error handling should be implemented in the code.

## Refactoring opportunities

- Code can be modularized and separated into functions to enhance readability and reusability.

- Use of more efficient data manipulation libraries like `dplyr` and `tidyverse` instead of base R functions.

- Leverage a configuration file to store settings and credentials rather than hard-coding them in the script.

- Replace multiple instances of similar operations with loops or a function call to reduce code repetition. For example, when creating multiple `data.table` objects by filtering on different conditions, consider using a loop or mapping function to iterate through the conditions and generate the `data.table` objects as needed.+++

# EmploymentFunnel 2023-04-08-2.R
# Overview

This code snippet is focused on extracting and analyzing data related to various events, customers, and statuses in the context of an Employment and Academic Summary service. The dataset being worked with consists of records related to individuals (`ind_id`) and their related report findings (`rff_id`). The script also includes various functions to handle data manipulation and extraction tasks.

# Functions

## fnGetByIdS

This function takes a vector of individual ids and returns information associated with each id.

```R
fnGetByIdS(individual_ids)
```

## fnSetFlag

This function takes a datatable and an event name, and sets a flag (1 or 0) for each row in the datatable based on the presence of the event name.

```R
fnSetFlag(DT, event_nm)
```

# Data Analysis

1. The code starts by working with various data tables, including `mgOut`, `DTmx2`, `lsM1`, and others.
2. It performs validation checks and data aggregation on various data fields such as `sku_status`, `response_status`, `processing_status`, etc.
3. Different subsets of data are generated, analyzed and written to CSV files based on specific dates, customer names or events.
4. The code snippet also deals with data related to email events, such as `Email_Dlv`, `Email_Opn`, and `Email_Clk`.
5. The `fnSetFlag` function is used to create flags for different event names found in the `DTmx3` datatable.
6. The code further analyzes the datatable `DTmx3` based on different event names and their corresponding counts.

# Risks

## Security Issues

1. There is exposure of hardcoded individual ids and customer names in the code, which could leak sensitive information about the clients being worked with.

## Bugs

1. There may be potential issues in terms of data type handling if the datasets being used are not sanitized or improperly formatted.

# Refactoring Opportunities

1. The code could benefit from using functions to standardize the process of filtering `mgOut`, `DTmx2`, and other datasets based on specific criteria and performing repeated calculation tasks.
2. The creation of flags in the `fnSetFlag` function can be optimized by using the `data.table` package's in-built capabilities for conditional computations.

# User Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Data Analysis

  Scenario: Dataset analysis based on specific dates, customer names, and events
    Given a dataset with individual ids, report finding ids, and event information
    When the code is executed to analyze the data based on specific dates, customer names, and events
    Then the output should be subsets of data, corresponding counts and aggregations, and CSV files with the requested information
  
  Scenario: Email events analysis
    Given a dataset with email events such as delivery, opening, and clicking
    When the code is executed to analyze these email events
    Then the output should be the counts and aggregations of email events and related information

  Scenario: Data flags based on event names
    Given a dataset with event names
    When the code is executed to create flags for different event names
    Then the output should be the flags (1 or 0) indicating the presence or absence of specific events in each row
