# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13.R
# Overview

The code provided handles a series of functions for data manipulation and extraction from different sources. It covers generic functions for handling operations such as aggregation, merging, and joining of data based on specified parameters. There are functions specific to handling data extraction from Mixpanel API, as well as utility functions for processing returned data.

# Generic Functions

1. **fnRecursivelyJoin**: This function is designed to join a base data.table (dtBase) with multiple data.tables (ls) recursively based on common key columns. It handles different lengths of the list (ls) and joins data.tables one by one. In addition, it fills missing data with 0 for the joined data.

2. **fnDailyVolumes**: Given an input data.table (dtSkus) and an interval (ntrv), this function calculates daily activity volumes and provides summary statistics. It filters the data based on specified dates and service codes, aggregates the data, replaces missing values with 0, and produces a final data.table as the result.

3. **fnSamCol**: The function combines dt1 and dt2, returning the common column names.

4. **getNwordVec** and **getNword**: These functions extract random words from a given wordList. getNwordVec extracts N number of random words from the list, while getNword extracts only the specified number of words from the list.

5. **fnMergeList**: This function recursively merges a list of data.tables (LSDT) based on the key vector (keyvec).

6. **fnFillNA**: This function fills NA values in the provided vector (vec) with the previous value in the vector.

7. **fnPrint1**: This function prints column values for a given data.table (DT) and row number (iii).

8. **is.date and fnFindDates**: These functions help in checking if an object is POSIXct and finding column names containing date values in a data.table (DT).

9. **fnDateChange**: This function changes the formatting of the date columns in a data.table (DT).

10. **fnComb**: Combines data.tables recursively based on a given set of columns (cols).

11. **fnJoin**: Joins two data.tables, DT1 and DT2, with an option for left join, left variable names, key vector, etc.

12. **fnSelfLink**: Creates a self-linked data.table based on specified columns.

13. **fnExclude**: Excludes columns from a given data.table based on a vector of column names (cvec).

14. **fnCreateSankeyData**: Creates a Sankey Data representation from a given data.table.

# Mixpanel Specific Elements

15. **fld_nam**: A vector of field names.

16. **fn_mixpanel_raw_export**: Function to fetch data from Mixpanel API. It takes the date range and keyBearer as inputs and returns the fetched data.

17. **fnCoalesce**: Coalesces two data sources based on a given column.

18. **mxDTprepJson**: Takes a JSON string as input and formats it to a suitable data.frame or data.table.

19. **fnFix5b**: A function that handles NULL values in the input list and applies the required conversion.

# Risks

## Security Issues

1. When passing keyBearer for the API calls, it is better to use a secure method like environment variables instead of hard coding it into the function.

## Bugs

There are no known bugs at this time.

# Refactoring Opportunities

1. Reduce the usage of global variables and input them as function parameters or encapsulate the code within a class.

2. Break down complex functions into smaller sub-functions to enable easier testing and debugging.

3. The comments can be more descriptive and elaborate on the role of the function and its parameters.

4. Follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions.

5. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle can be followed more strictly by eliminating repeated functionality and reusing functions. This will help in reducing the code size and making the script more modular.+++

# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13.R
# Overview

This code contains a series of functions that perform various operations on data. The functions are classified as generic and Mixpanel-specific. Generic functions are used for operations like data manipulation and data extraction, while Mixpanel-specific functions focus on extracting and processing data from [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), a platform that helps businesses to analyze their users' behavior.

The code can be divided into two sections:

1. **Generic Functions**: These include functions like `fnRecursivelyJoin`, `fnDailyVolumes`, `fnSamCol`, `getNwordVec`, and others that help manipulate data, join tables, and perform specific actions on the given data.
2. **Mixpanel Specific Elements**: This section has `fld_nam` array defining names of fields, and function `fn_mixpanel_raw_export` which is responsible for accessing the Mixpanel API and fetching data in a specific format.

Let's take a closer look at each of the generic functions and then the Mixpanel-specific elements.

## Generic Functions

### 1. fnRecursivelyJoin

The `fnRecursivelyJoin` function takes a base dataset `dtBase` and a list of datasets `ls` as inputs. It recursively performs inner joins between `dtBase` and each of the datasets in the list `ls`. This function returns a single dataset that is the result of all the joins.

### 2. fnDailyVolumes

This function calculates daily volumes for a given dataset `dtSkus` and an interval `ntrv`. It filters rows based on specific date ranges and service codes, then aggregates the data by 'act_id'. Finally, the function returns a new dataset with the calculated daily volumes along with other related statistics.

### 3. fnSamCol

The `fnSamCol` function takes two data frames as inputs and returns a vector of column names that are common to both data frames.

### 4. getNwordVec

This function returns a vector of N concatenated words, given a word list `wordList`, a number of words `nWords`, and an optional seed value `seed_val`.

### 5. fnMergeList

The `fnMergeList` function takes a list of data tables (`LSDT`) and a vector of key column names (`keyvec`). It merges all the tables in the list using the specified key column names and returns the resulting data table.

## Mixpanel Specific Elements

### fld_nam

The `fld_nam` variable is the names of the columns needed from the Mixpanel data.

### fn_mixpanel_raw_export

The `fn_mixpanel_raw_export` function fetches raw event data from Mixpanel's API for a specific date range (`from_date`, `to_date`) and an API `keyBearer`. The timeout limit `timeout_limit` can be set. It returns the fetched data as a JSON format.

## Risks

### Security Issues

There are no security issues identified in the given code.

### Bugs

There are no bugs identified in the given code.

## Refactoring Opportunities

1. The code can be refactored to use libraries like [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) to make the data manipulation and extraction operations more readable and efficient.
2. Some functions have similar functionalities, such as `fnJoin` and `fnMergeList`. These can be combined into a single function with additional parameters to reduce redundancy.
3. Some portions of the code have commented out variables that are not used. These can be removed to make the code cleaner.

## User Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Daily Volumes Calculation
  Scenario: Calculate daily volumes for a given dataset and interval
    Given a dataset 'dtSkus' and an interval 'ntrv'
    When I call the 'fnDailyVolumes' function
    Then I should get a new dataset with correctly calculated daily volumes and related statistics for each 'act_id'

Feature: Data Extraction from Mixpanel
  Scenario: Extract raw events data from Mixpanel's API
    Given a date range 'from_date' and 'to_date'
    And an API key 'keyBearer'
    When I call the 'fn_mixpanel_raw_export' function
    Then I should get the fetched data in JSON format
