# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-3.R
# Overview

This R script contains two main functions: `fnGetPostgresData2` and `fnGetUnidays`. The purpose of the script is to extract data from a PostgreSQL database (using `RODBC`) and perform certain data manipulations before returning the results as a data table.

1. `fnGetPostgresData2` is a function that establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the provided credentials and then calls the `fnGetUnidays` function to fetch the data.
2. `fnGetUnidays` is a function that takes the ODBC channel as an input and runs an SQL query to obtain the required data.

## fnGetPostgresData2

### Inputs:

- `start_date` (default is `NULL`): Start date for data extraction.
- `username` (default is `Sys.getenv('userid')`): Database username.
- `pwd` (default is `Sys.getenv('pstgPwd')`): Database password.
- `echo` (default is `F`): Option to print progress messages.

### Overview of function:

1. Sets a default value for the start date if it is not provided.
2. Constructs the connection string using the given input parameters and the default driver and server values.
3. Connects to the PostgreSQL database using the connection string.
4. Calls the `fnGetUnidays` function, passing the ODBC channel as an argument to fetch the data.
5. Closes the ODBC channel.
6. Returns the fetched data table.

## fnGetUnidays

### Inputs:

- `odbc_channel`: ODBC channel to the PostgreSQL database.

### Overview of function:

1. Creates an SQL query (`sql_01`), which fetches the required data from various tables in the PostgreSQL database.
2. Executes the SQL query using the given ODBC channel and stores the results in a data table `exb_01`.
3. Trims extra spaces from the `customer_name` column in the data table.
4. Returns the processed data table.

# Risks

## Security Issues

1. The current script uses a plain-text password for the PostgreSQL connection. It is better to encrypt or use environment variables to handle sensitive information.

## Bugs

None found.

# Refactoring Opportunities

1. The SQL query in `fnGetUnidays` could be structured better, with proper indentation and comments that would improve the readability.
2. The use of meaningful variable names for intermediate processing steps would also help in code understanding.+++

# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-3.R
# Overview

The presented R script consists of two main functions `fnGetPostgresData2` and `fnGetUnidays` that extracts specific data from a PostgreSQL database and returns the required information as a data.table. The script essentially connects to the database, fetches customer tokens, and retrieves additional information by executing a SQL query.

## Function: fnGetPostgresData2

This function is responsible for:

1. Setting default values for function parameters.
2. Checking for the existence of the database driver.
3. Establishing a connection with a PostgreSQL database using the given username, password, and provided connection strings.
4. Fetching and processing customer tokens by invoking the `fnGetUnidays` function.
5. Closing the connection to the PostgreSQL database.

### Parameters:

- `start_date`: The starting date for the data fetching process. If not provided, a default value of '2020-06-01' will be used.
- `username`: Database username; fetched from the environment variable 'userid' if not provided.
- `pwd`: Database password; fetched from the environment variable 'pstgPwd' if not provided.
- `echo`: If TRUE, the function will print out progress messages, by default set to FALSE.

## Function: fnGetUnidays

This function is responsible for fetching data from the PostgreSQL database using an SQL query and preprocessing the result into a data.table.

### Parameters:

- `odbc_channel`: The ODBC connection object created during the database connection.

# Risks

## Security Issues

- No major security issues identified within provided code.

## Bugs

- The code does not handle any potential errors or exceptions during the database connection and querying process. For example, there are no try-catch mechanisms or error handling for unsuccessful database connections, SQL errors, or NULL data returns.

# Refactoring Opportunities

- Improve error handling: Add robust error handling mechanisms to address potential issues while connecting to the database, executing SQL queries, and processing the results.
- Modularize SQL Query: Separate the SQL query into a smaller, more manageable, and reusable module or function.
- Use Parameterized Queries: Replace the hardcoded values in the SQL queries with parameterized queries to make the function more flexible and secure.

# User Acceptance Criteria

## Feature: Data extraction from PostgreSQL

### Scenario: Extract and process customer tokens

```gherkin
  Given a PostgreSQL database connection
  When the `fnGetPostgresData2` function is invoked
  Then the customer tokens should be fetched and processed by the `fnGetUnidays` function
  And returned as a data.table
```

### Scenario: Return an empty data.table if no data is fetched

```gherkin
  Given a PostgreSQL database connection
  When the `fnGetUnidays` function queries an empty result set
  Then the function should return an empty data.table
```
