# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-3.R
# Overview

This R script contains two main functions: `fnGetPostgresData2` and `fnGetUnidays`. The purpose of the script is to extract data from a PostgreSQL database (using `RODBC`) and perform certain data manipulations before returning the results as a data table.

1. `fnGetPostgresData2` is a function that establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the provided credentials and then calls the `fnGetUnidays` function to fetch the data.
2. `fnGetUnidays` is a function that takes the ODBC channel as an input and runs an SQL query to obtain the required data.

## fnGetPostgresData2

### Inputs:

- `start_date` (default is `NULL`): Start date for data extraction.
- `username` (default is `Sys.getenv('userid')`): Database username.
- `pwd` (default is `Sys.getenv('pstgPwd')`): Database password.
- `echo` (default is `F`): Option to print progress messages.

### Overview of function:

1. Sets a default value for the start date if it is not provided.
2. Constructs the connection string using the given input parameters and the default driver and server values.
3. Connects to the PostgreSQL database using the connection string.
4. Calls the `fnGetUnidays` function, passing the ODBC channel as an argument to fetch the data.
5. Closes the ODBC channel.
6. Returns the fetched data table.

## fnGetUnidays

### Inputs:

- `odbc_channel`: ODBC channel to the PostgreSQL database.

### Overview of function:

1. Creates an SQL query (`sql_01`), which fetches the required data from various tables in the PostgreSQL database.
2. Executes the SQL query using the given ODBC channel and stores the results in a data table `exb_01`.
3. Trims extra spaces from the `customer_name` column in the data table.
4. Returns the processed data table.

# Risks

## Security Issues

1. The current script uses a plain-text password for the PostgreSQL connection. It is better to encrypt or use environment variables to handle sensitive information.

## Bugs

None found.

# Refactoring Opportunities

1. The SQL query in `fnGetUnidays` could be structured better, with proper indentation and comments that would improve the readability.
2. The use of meaningful variable names for intermediate processing steps would also help in code understanding.
