# EmploymentFunnel2.R
# Overview

This script is primarily utilized for data extraction, transformation and loading for employment funnel data. It relies on multiple libraries to read, manipulate, and process the data. Included libraries: `httr`, `data.table`, `base64`, `bit64`, `jsonlite`, `RODBC`, `googlesheets4`, `lubridate`, `zoo`, and `feather`. The processed data is then written to a CSV file.

### 1. Library Import

The script begins by importing several libraries:

```R
library(httr)
library(data.table)
library(base64)
library(bit64)
library(jsonlite)
library(data.table)
library(RODBC)
library(googlesheets4)
library(lubridate)
library(zoo)
library(feather)
```

### 2. Mixpanel Data Extraction

The `fn_mixpanel_raw_export` and `mxDTfromJson` functions are used to extract data from Mixpanel, an event tracking and analytics platform. The Mixpanel API is utilized by providing the specific date range and required key value.

```R
mx_keyBearer <- '27b46442ab4299479c3dce41998e1b68'

json <- fn_mixpanel_raw_export(
    lubridate::as_date('2021-12-16')
  , lubridate::as_date('2021-12-17')
  , mx_keyBearer
)

dt1 <- mxDTfromJson(json,echo=T)
```

### 3. Data Transformation

The script performs multiple data transformation tasks, such as:

- Converting data types
- Filtering data based on dates
- Extracting and formatting JSON data
- Removing duplicates from raw data
- Combining data with various techniques

### 4. Data Loading

At the end of the script, processed data is loaded into a CSV file for further analysis and usage.

```R
fwrite(DTout,filnm)
```

### 5. Risks

#### i. Security issues

- The Mixpanel key value (`mx_keyBearer`) is hardcoded in the script. This could potentially expose sensitive authentication information. 

#### ii. Bugs

- The use of hardcoded dates could lead to incorrect analysis or missed data points. It's better to use dynamic dates.

### 6. Refactoring Opportunities

- The script contains some repeating code sections that can be combined into a function to reduce redundancy.
- Error handling can be improved to catch and report issues during the data extraction and transformation process.
- Comments can be improved for better readability and understanding of the code.
