# EmploymentFunnel 2023-04-08-2.R
## Overview

The code in question performs various data extraction and transformation operations and reads/writes data from different sources like files and APIs. The main purpose of the script is to process the data and generate statistics or extract specific information to be used in further analysis.

In the following sections, we will go through each part of the code and provide explanations for important functions and data operations.

## Data extraction & filtering

1. Extract data from various sources:

   - `DTcustnw`, `mgOut`, `dt_efuse`, `lsM1`, `DT_delv`, `DT_msg`, `dtSkus`, `DTmx2`, `mgOutNTA`, `DTmx3`.
   
   - Data is also extracted from various API calls such as `updateDataCio()`.

2. Filtering and processing data based on conditions:

   - Filter data by specific dates, e.g. `mgOut[rff_created_at>'2023/01/01',.N,by=c('act_id','customer_name')]`.

   - Aggregate data and count by certain fields, e.g. `dt_efuse[,.N,by=c('sku_status')]`.

## Data transformation

1. Compute various statistics and aggregations, e.g. counting the number of records by specific fields or calculating the average of certain columns.

2. Create various data tables and data frames by filtering and processing the extracted data.

3. Use various helper functions such as `fnGetByIdS`, `fnSetFlag`, and `fnJoin` to aid in data manipulation and processing.

## Risks

### Security issues

- The code might not handle authentication or access control properly when dealing with APIs and sensitive data. Credentials and tokens should be stored securely and not embedded within the script.

### Bugs

- The code might produce incorrect results if the input data formats change unexpectedly. Proper validation and error handling should be implemented in the code.

## Refactoring opportunities

- Code can be modularized and separated into functions to enhance readability and reusability.

- Use of more efficient data manipulation libraries like `dplyr` and `tidyverse` instead of base R functions.

- Leverage a configuration file to store settings and credentials rather than hard-coding them in the script.

- Replace multiple instances of similar operations with loops or a function call to reduce code repetition. For example, when creating multiple `data.table` objects by filtering on different conditions, consider using a loop or mapping function to iterate through the conditions and generate the `data.table` objects as needed.
