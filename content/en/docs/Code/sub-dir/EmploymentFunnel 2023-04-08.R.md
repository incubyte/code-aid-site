# EmploymentFunnel 2023-04-08.R
# Overview

This code reviews the script provided and provides detailed explanations for each section. The main goal of the script is to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources related to employment funnels, perform several operations on the collected data, and generate various reports such as funnel and Sankey reports, daily volumes report, weekly fail report, and itemized report.

The script mainly consists of the following sections:

1. Update Mixpanel
2. Update Customer.IO
3. Update M1 Data (PostgreSQL)
4. Process Data
5. ETL Operations on Data
6. Create and Update Reports
7. Update Remote File

# 1. Update Mixpanel

This section reads the stored Mixpanel data from a .csv file, gets the Mixpanel data using an API key, updates Mixpanel data with new data fetched, and writes the combined data back into the .csv file.

* Loading packages
* Reading stored data from .csv file
* Calling Mixpanel API for data
* Preprocessing Mixpanel JSON data
* Updating stored data with new data
* Writing combined data back into .csv file

# 2. Update Customer.IO

This section updates various data related to Customer.IO, such as delivered_email, opened_email, clicked_email, message details, customer tokens, and campaigns, using the provided API key.

* Define and set up API key
* Update delivered_email, opened_email, clicked_email, and message details data
* Merge and join datasets with additional information

# 3. Update M1 Data (PostgreSQL)

This section connects to a PostgreSQL database to extract various pieces of data, such as customer tokens, SKUs, invitations, funnel reports, and M1 Plaid data. It defines a series of helper functions to query the data and process it.

* Establish a connection with the PostgreSQL database
* Define helper functions for querying data
* Extract data by executing SQL queries with helper functions

# 4. Process Data

This section processes the data fetched from Mixpanel, Customer.IO, and M1 Data by performing several data cleaning operations and transformations. It combines data from different sources and prepares it for generating various reports.

* Perform data cleaning on Mixpanel data
* Clean up pseudo_id in the data
* Combine Mixpanel and Customer.IO data using helper functions
* Add Plaid data and click time into the data
* Organize and clean data for further analysis

# 5. ETL Operations on Data

This section performs various ETL operations on the data, such as data cleaning, aggregation, and manipulation, to prepare it for generating reports.

* Data cleaning, aggregation, and manipulation
* Exclude unwanted columns from the data
* Computing various statistics and other transformations on the data

# 6. Create and Update Reports

This section generates various reports such as Funnel, Sankey Reports, Daily Volumes Report, Weekly Fail Report, and Itemized Report based on the processed data. 

* Funnel data generation and cleaning
* Sankey data generation
* Daily Volumes report generation
* Weekly Fail report generation
* Itemized Report generation

# 7. Update Remote File

This section uploads the generated reports to AWS S3 for storage and accessibility.

* Set up AWS IAM credentials
* Upload generated reports to AWS S3 as .csv files

# Risks

## Security Issues

- Hard-coded API keys and database credentials should be stored in a secure way, such as environment variables, or a secrets manager for better security.
- The Mixpanel and Customer.IO API keys are visible in the code, which could potentially expose sensitive data if the code is shared or accessed by unauthorized users.

## Bugs

- Upon code review, no major bugs were found.

# Refactoring Opportunities

- Functions and sections can be separated into their own files and called by main script for better code organization and readability.
- Use of environment variables or secure storage for sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials could be implemented to increase security.
- Better error handling and logging can be added to the script, especially during API calls, to better handle edge cases and make the script more maintainable.
