# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-2C.R
## Overview

This script performs data analysis and processing for customer invitation events containing several operations like data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). The main goal of this script is to analyze and process invitation events data, handle potential risks, and refactor the code to make it more efficient.

## Functions

### 1. fnFunnelClean

This function takes in three inputs (DTmx, lsM1, and DT_msg) and performs data cleaning and processing for the customer invitation events. It first filters and processes the email-related data, calculates the click event data, and groups the data by the customer_id.

Next, it joins the data from different sources based on the act_id and invitation_source, and indexes the data using the .N function from the data.table package. Finally, the function groups the data based on various conditions and operations such as email delivery, opening, clicking, and categorizing individual activities.

### 2. fnGetMxStatus

This function takes in two input arguments (DTem and invec) and calculates the maximum status value for each customer_id in the dataset. It then categorizes this status value based on the given input vector (invec) and creates a new column with the status level.

### 3. fnAddFunnel2

This function takes in two input arguments (DTem and DTmx) and adds the Funnel level 2 to the dataset. It merges the datasets based on common pseudo_id and performs operations on different Funnel levels (Email_Dlv, Email_Opn, Email_Clk, HP_Act, and Data_Src).

### 4. fnAddClickTime

This function takes in the input argument mgDT and adds click_time to it based on different timestamp columns.

### 5. fnPlaidGrab

This function extracts the relevant records from the input dataset and calculates the maximum ID for each customer.

### 6. fnPlaidLast

This function takes in the input dataset and returns the last event recorded for each user.

### 7. fnDataPlaid

This function performs data joining and processing for the specific datasets.

### 8. fnUpdateMonthly

This function updates monthly values in the data by calculating the total number of invitations, activities, and various statuses split by customer_id.

### 9. fnGetMonthly

This function calculates the monthly values for each customer_id in the dataset based on different statuses and measures.

## Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)

1. Data Extraction: The data is primarily extracted from the input datasets (DTmx, lsM1, and DT_msg) provided to the function `fnFunnelClean`.

2. Data Transformation: The data is transformed and processed within various functions like `fnFunnelClean`, `fnGetMxStatus`, `fnAddFunnel2`, and `fnAddClickTime`. The transformation includes activities like filtering, joining, calculating, and categorizing.

3. Data Loading: The results from the functions are combined and structured in the final dataset, including measures and statuses.

## Risks

### Security Issues

The script does not use any specific encryption or security measures to protect the sensitive user data. It is advisable to add security features such as masking personal identifiable information (PII) or using secure communication protocols when transferring data between different functions or systems.

### Bugs

There might be possible bugs due to missing data, duplicate records, or incorrect data formats. Proper data validation checks and error handling should be added to prevent any potential data corruption issues.

## Refactoring Opportunities

1. Create helper functions to modularize the code, as there are many repetitive operations like filtering and joining performed in the functions.

2. Optimize the data joining and processing logic by using more efficient functions and optimizing memory usage.

3. Use better naming conventions for variables and functions to improve code readability.

4. Add proper code documentation and comments to make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code.+++

# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-2C.R
# Overview

This script performs various operations on data and aims to manipulate and analyze the data to generate actionable insights. The code mainly revolves around data processing functions that help to clean, transform, and extract insights from the input data.

# Functions

In this section, we will discuss the different functions defined throughout the script and what they do.

## 1. fnFunnelClean

This function takes three input parameters, `DTmx`, `lsM1`, and `DT_msg`. Its primary purpose is to clean the data and join relevant information to attain the desired dataset. It then returns the combined dataset `DTem5` after performing a series of data cleaning operations, joining and transforming steps.

## 2. fnGetMxStatus

This function takes `DTem`, `invec`, `outvec`, and `fld_nm` as input parameters, and it is responsible for performing some sorting, grouping and transformation operations on the input dataset `DTem`. It returns a cleaned dataset `lk_level1` with the relevant transformations applied.

## 3. fnAddFunnel2

This function takes `DTem` and `DTmx` as input parameters and processes step-specific information by performing a series of joins and grouping operations. It creates a dataset `mgDT` that contains the processed data and returns this dataset.

## 4. fnAddClickTime

This function takes `mgDT`, `DTmx2`, `DT_delv2`, and `DT_clik` as input parameters and applies a series of joins, transformations, and data cleaning operations to calculate the click time. It then returns the updated dataset `mgDT0`.

## 5. fnPlaidGrab

This function takes `DT` and `event` as input parameters and returns a dataset `DTup` after performing a series of filtering and manipulation operations on the input dataset `DT`.

## 6. fnPlaidLast

This function takes `DT` and `event` as input parameters and returns a dataset `DTpl` after performing a variety of transformations, cleaning operations, and grouping while handling the provided event names.

## 7. fnDataPlaid

This function takes `DTmx2` and `lsM1` as input parameters and is responsible for performing joins and transformations to create a final dataset `DTpl_out` based on Plaid data.

## 8. fnAddPlaid

This function takes `mgDT` as input and updates some columns of the dataset based on a specific condition, `datasource_id`. It returns the updated dataset `mgDT`.

## 9. fnUpdateMonthly

This function takes `dtBase`, `dtIn`, `PrevMeasure`, and `MeasureName` as input parameters and updates the monthly dataset with the respective measures. It then returns the updated dataset.

## 10. fnGetMonthly

This function takes `mgOut2` as input and generates a `dtMonthly` dataset containing aggregations based on measures related to customer interactions, host portal activities, and datasource classifications. It returns the aggregated `dtMonthly` dataset.

# Risks

## Security Issues

There are no apparent security issues in the script.

## Bugs

There are no apparent bugs in the script.

# Refactoring Opportunities

1. Create smaller helper functions that perform specific tasks to break down large functions like `fnFunnelClean`. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

2. Properly comment the code explaining each step or transformation to make the code easy to understand for others.

3. Remove hardcoded values (e.g., dates) and replace them with variables or constants.

4. Use consistent and meaningful variable and function names throughout the script.
