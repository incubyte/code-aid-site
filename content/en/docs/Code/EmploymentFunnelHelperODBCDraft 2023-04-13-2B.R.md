# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-2B.R
# Overview

This script is written in R and performs data cleaning, extraction, transformation, and loading for multiple functions. The code consists of multiple functions to process the input data, perform the necessary transformations, and create summaries of the data. The following sections explain the functions in detail.

## Function: fnCleanMxp

This function is responsible for cleaning input data (mxDT) and returning a cleaned data table (DTmx1). It performs the following main steps:

1. Separate the input data into two different data tables (dtMXA and dtMXB) based on a condition (grepl_uni).
2. Process dtMXA by modifying the tmp_url column using multiple conditions and regular expressions.
3. Create a new data table (DT_tk) using lapply and cbind it with dtMXA.
4. Assign specific values to dtMXB for columns current_domain, current_token, and current_dynamic.
5. Combine dtMXA and dtMXB using rbindlist.
6. Modify the pseudo_id column by applying the dplyr::coalesce function on current_dynamic and event_distinct_id columns.

## Function: fnCleanAllSkus

This function cleans the input data table (DTsku) and returns a new cleaned data table (exb_06) with specific columns. It follows these main steps:

1. Filter the input data based on multiple conditions for service_code and sku_status.
2. Aggregate the filtered data using data.table::dcast and create new columns based on specific conditions.
3. Keep a set of columns from the aggregated data and assign it to exb_06.
4. Modify specific rows in exb_06 based on given conditions for individual_ids (hc_dv and hc_dnp).
5. Rename the columns of exb_06 according to the given names.

## Function: fnAddPostGre

This function is responsible for performing various data operations on the input data (dtMX) and connecting it with PostgreSQL data (lsPSTG). It performs the following operations:

1. Set the maximum pull_time value from the input data.
2. Get PostgreSQL data based on the given conditionals for lsPSTG and start_date.
3. Perform various filtering, transforming, and aggregating operations on extracted PostgreSQL data (exb_01, exb_02, and exb_03).
4. Modify the prodacct column of exb_01 based on specific conditions.
5. Join input data (dtMX) with exb_01 using data.table's setkeyv and fnJoin functions.
6. Perform multiple operations on exb_03 and exb_01 and create data tables (exb_05, exb_06, and exb_07).
7. Combine the modified dtMX with exb_05, exb_06, and exb_07 using rbindlist.
8. Modify the columns of the combined data table (dtMX) using dplyr::coalesce and fnJoin with exb_02.

## Function: fnAddOtherFtrs

This function adds other features to the input data table (DT) and returns a modified data table (dtMX). It mainly computes the minimum event_time for each combination of pseudo_id and user_id_comb.

## Function: fnCreateMxpSummary

This function creates a summary of the input data table (DT) and returns the data table (dtSumm) containing aggregated information. It consists of the following main steps:

1. Aggregate the input data based on pseudo_id and event_time.
2. Create data tables for various event_name conditions like dtAppInit, dtProfile, dtSchool, etc.
3. Combine all the aggregated data tables into one summary data table (dtSumm) using fnComb function and pseudo_id as key column.

## Function: fnCleanUpPseudoId

This function cleans up the pseudo_id in the input data table (DTmx) and returns a modified data table (DTmx2). It performs the following operations:

1. Replace missing values in rff_id and ind_id columns in DTmx.
2. Join DTmx with lsM1[[1]] based on the current_token column.
3. Filter the obtained data by removing account_type = 'INTERNAL' and current_token in a specified list ("garbage", "m1_demo_test").
4. Order the filtered data by event_time.
5. Update the rownum column according to the new order.

## Risks

### Security issues

There are no specific security issues identified in this code.

### Bugs

There are no obvious bugs present in this code, given that it has been provided on its own and without context.

## Refactoring opportunities

1. The code can be further modularized and optimized by breaking down large functions into smaller, focused sub-functions.
2. Consistent naming conventions can be applied to variables and columns throughout the script.
3. Some repetitive calculations or operations can be made into separate functions that can be called multiple times, reducing code redundancy.
4. Error handling and input validation can be added to the functions to enhance their robustness and maintainability.+++

# EmploymentFunnelHelperODBCDraft 2023-04-13-2B.R
# Overview

This code is written in R programming language and is designed to clean, process and refactor data related to various events, actions and users involved in a data processing pipeline. The code consists of multiple functions, each responsible for specific tasks such as cleaning event data, updating the data with additional features, creating summary statistics and performing other operations.

# Function explanations

## 1. fnCleanMxp

This function takes the following inputs:

- mxDT: A data.table containing event data
- echo: A boolean flag for enabling or disabling print statements (default is True)

The main objective of this function is to clean and process the URLs present in the event data. It performs the following operations:

1. Separates the event data into two different data.tables (dtMXA and dtMXB) based on the presence of the word 'unidays' in the URLs
2. Extracts and processes the various components of the URLs
3. Combines the processed data.tables (dtMXA and dtMXB) into a single data.table (DTmx1)
4. Adds a 'pseudo_id' column to DTmx1, which is a combination of 'current_dynamic' and 'event_distinct_id'

## 2. fnCleanAllSkus

This function takes the following input:

- DTsku: A data.table containing SKU data

The objective of this function is to clean, aggregate and transform the SKU data to be used for subsequent analysis. It performs the following operations:

1. Filters and groups the data based on various conditions
2. Aggregates the data using functions like count, min
3. Processes and adds additional columns
4. Renames and keeps only necessary columns

## 3. fnAddPostGre

This function takes the following inputs:

- dtMX: A data.table containing event data
- lsPSTG: A list of data.tables extracted from a PostgreSQL database
- start_date: A date from which to filter the event data
- echo: A boolean flag for enabling or disabling print statements (default is True)

The main objective of this function is to update the event data with additional features from the PostgreSQL data. It performs the following operations:
