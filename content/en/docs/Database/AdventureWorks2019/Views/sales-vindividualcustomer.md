## Overview

The [Sales].[vIndividualCustomer] view in the provided database query lists individual customers and their associated information, such as contact details and address.

## Details

This view is created using an SQL `SELECT` statement with various fields selected from multiple tables. The selected fields provide comprehensive information about individual customers.

## Information on data

The data in the view is extracted from the following tables:

1. Person
2. BusinessEntityAddress
3. Address
4. StateProvince
5. CountryRegion
6. AddressType
7. Customer
8. EmailAddress
9. PersonPhone
10. PhoneNumberType

## Information on the tables

The tables provide customer information, address details, and contact details. Information about the relationships between tables is represented using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, and `WHERE` clauses.

## Possible optimization opportunities

To optimize the view, consider:

1. Indexing columns used in the `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses to speed up the data retrieval process.
2. Reducing the number of selected columns if some of them are not needed in the final result set.
3. Using covering indexes to include important columns that are not part of the key.

## Possible bugs

There do not appear to be any bugs in the provided view definition.

## Risk

1. As the query grows in complexity, the execution time for the view may increase, affecting performance.
2. Changes in the schema of the underlying tables may lead to errors or incorrect results in the view.

## Code Complexity

The code has a relatively low complexity as it only contains a single `SELECT` statement to retrieve the data. However, the query involves a combination of `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, as well as multiple conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

## Refactoring Opportunities

Refactoring options could include:

1. Splitting the view into multiple smaller views that focus on specific aspects of the data (e.g., contact details, address details).
2. Implementing stored procedures, instead of views, to handle complex data retrieval logic and improve performance.
