| View |  12 | HumanResources.Employee, Person.Person, HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory, HumanResources.Department |


## Overview
The `HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartment` view retrieves employee information along with their department details. 

## Details
This view consists of a SELECT statement to retrieve the following columns:
1. BusinessEntityID
2. Title
3. FirstName
4. MiddleName
5. LastName
6. Suffix
7. JobTitle
8. Department
9. GroupName
10. StartDate

The view is based on the `HumanResources.Employee`, `Person.Person`, `HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory`, and `HumanResources.Department` tables. Inner joins are used to combine the tables based on the `BusinessEntityID` and `DepartmentID`.

## Information on data
The data returned by this view contains the employee's personal information, their job title, and their department affiliation. This information is retrieved from four different tables, which are combined using inner joins.

## Information on the tables
1. **HumanResources.Employee**: This table contains the employee's details, such as their job title and business entity ID.
2. **Person.Person**: This table stores the personal information of the employees.
3. **HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory**: This table maintains the historical data of employees associated with their department.
4. **HumanResources.Department**: This table contains the department details, including the department name and group name.

## Possible optimization opportunities
Since the view uses INNER JOIN, only the matching records from all the tables are returned. If any record does not exist in any one of the tables, the employee's details will not be included in the result set. Depending on the use case, you could consider using a LEFT JOIN or OUTER JOIN to ensure all employee records are displayed, even if a match is not found in one of the tables.

## Possible bugs
As this view relies on INNER JOIN, possible bugs may arise if any table's data is not properly maintained, leading to missing employee records in the result set. It is essential to ensure data integrity and proper schema relationships between the tables.

## Risk
Currently, there are no risks as the view is constructed correctly, and there are no WHERE clauses without proper conditions. Maintaining data integrity in the tables is essential to avoid potential issues.

## Code Complexity
The code is relatively simple, with one SELECT statement performing INNER JOIN between four tables to retrieve employee and department information.

## Refactoring Opportunities
There are no immediate refactoring opportunities. However, depending on the use case, you could consider modifying the JOIN types (LEFT JOIN or OUTER JOIN) to ensure all employee records are displayed, even if a match is not found in one of the tables.
