## 1. Overview

This markdown documentation describes the `[dbo].[ufnGetProductDealerPrice]` function, which calculates the dealer price for a specific product & order date by applying a discount.

## 2. Details

**Function Name**: `[dbo].[ufnGetProductDealerPrice]`

**Parameters**:
- `@ProductID [int]`: ID of the product for which the dealer price should be calculated.
- `@OrderDate [datetime]`: Date on which the order has been placed.

**Return Type**: `[money]`: Returns the dealer price for the product on the specified order date.

## 3. Information on data

The function uses the following tables and columns:

**Table**: `[Production].[Product]`
- `ProductID`

**Table**: `[Production].[ProductListPriceHistory]`
- `ListPrice`
- `StartDate`
- `EndDate`

## 4. Information on the tables

1. **[Production].[Product]**: Contains information about each product.
2. **[Production].[ProductListPriceHistory]**: Contains the history of price changes for each product.

## 5. Possible optimization opportunities

- Using a parameter for the dealer discount instead of a fixed value would provide more flexibility.
- Caching frequently requested dealer prices may improve performance.

## 6. Possible bugs

- If the `@OrderDate` is null, behavior is undefined.

## 7. Risk

- The function runs without a `WHERE` clause, risking performance issues on large tables.
- The discount calculation only considers the `ListPrice` value, not other potential factors (e.g., promotions or rebates).

## 8. Code Complexity

The code complexity is relatively low, as it consists of a single `SELECT` statement, joining the `Product` and `ProductListPriceHistory` tables and calculating the discounted price.

## 9. Refactoring Opportunities

- Encapsulate the discount calculation within another function, allowing easier modifications of this business rule in the future.

## 10. User Acceptance Criteria

**Gherkin Scripts:**

```Gherkin
Feature: Calculate Dealer Price
  As a user, I want to calculate the dealer price for a product on a specific order date

  Scenario: Calculate dealer price for a valid product and order date
    Given I have a valid Product ID
    And I have a valid order date
    When I call the ufnGetProductDealerPrice function
    Then I should receive the dealer price for that product on that order date

  Scenario: Handle NULL order date
    Given I have a valid Product ID
    And I have a NULL order date
    When I call the ufnGetProductDealerPrice function
    Then I should receive an error or default value
```
