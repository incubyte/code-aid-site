## Overview

This documentation provides an analysis of the `ufnGetAccountingEndDate` function created in the database. The function returns the accounting end date, which is calculated by subtracting 2 milliseconds from the provided date.

## Details

### Function Name: ufnGetAccountingEndDate

### Function Definition
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[ufnGetAccountingEndDate]()
RETURNS [datetime] 
AS 
BEGIN
    RETURN DATEADD(millisecond, -2, CONVERT(datetime, '20040701', 112));
END;
```

## Information on data

1. Input: No input parameter needed.
2. Output: The output is a single `datetime` value.

## Information on the tables

No tables are used for this function.

## Possible optimization opportunities

No optimization opportunities are detected as the function's calculation is minimal and doesn't depend on any external resources.

## Possible bugs

Since the function does not involve any input parameters, tables, or dependencies, the chance of encountering bugs is very low.

## Risk

The function does not include a WHERE clause, and no risk related to it has been identified. The hard-coded date ('20040701') might be the only potential risk if there's a need for an updated accounting end date in the future.

## Code Complexity

The code is simple and easy to understand, requiring basic knowledge of SQL functions and date manipulation. There is no room for confusion or misunderstandings regarding its behavior.

## Refactoring Opportunities

There are no immediate refactoring opportunities as the code is already minimal and serves its purpose effectively. However, if a dynamic input date is desired in the future, a parameter can be added to the function to achieve this.
