## Overview
A user-defined scalar function, `ufnGetPurchaseOrderStatusText`, is being created in the `dbo` schema. It takes an input parameter of type `tinyint` and returns the corresponding status text as a string `nvarchar(15)`.

## Details

**Function Name:** `ufnGetPurchaseOrderStatusText`

**Parameters:**

1. `@Status [tinyint]` - The status value for which we want to get the status text.

**Return Type:** `[nvarchar](15)` - The function returns a string of maximum 15 characters, which is the status text representation of the input status value.

## Information on Data

The function doesn't depend on any table or data from the database. Instead, it uses a simple `CASE` statement to map the input status value to its corresponding status text.

## Information on the Tables

There is no table involved in this function as it uses a `CASE` statement only.

## Possible Optimization Opportunities

As the function is simple and doesn't involve any complex operations or querying any database tables or views, there seems to be no room for further optimization.

## Possible Bugs

There are no possible bugs that can be identified in this function, as it doesn't interact with any other database objects or external systems, and its logic is very simple.

## Risk

Since the function only uses a `CASE` statement, there are no statements without a `WHERE` clause, and therefore, no need to highlight any risks.

## Code Complexity

The code is very simple, with the only complexity lying in the `CASE` statement used to map input status value to its corresponding status text.

```sql
SET @ret = 
    CASE @Status
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Pending'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Approved'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Rejected'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Complete'
        ELSE '** Invalid **'
    END;
```

## Refactoring Opportunities

No refactoring is required since the function is already as simple as it can be, serving its purpose effectively.
