## Overview
The `ufnGetSalesOrderStatusText` function accepts a `tinyint` input as the sales order status code and returns the corresponding status as a text representation. The function is designed to help retrieve human-readable sales order status descriptions for respective numeric codes in the database.

## Details
- *Name*: ufnGetSalesOrderStatusText
- *Type*: User-defined function
- *Input Parameters*: @Status (tinyint) - The sales order status code
- *Return Type*: nvarchar(15) - The corresponding sales order status text

## Information on data
The function uses a single input parameter `@Status` which represents the status codes of sales orders. These codes are assumed to be stored in a database table as tinyint values.

## Information on the tables
There are no specific tables used within the function as it only accepts a single status code as input and returns a text value by matching it with the pre-defined criteria in the form of a CASE statement.

## Possible optimization opportunities
As this function does not perform any complex operations, there are no apparent optimization opportunities.

## Possible bugs
As the function relies on a fixed set of status codes and corresponding text values, unmapped status codes will result in '** Invalid **' being returned. If a new status code is introduced, the function must be updated to accommodate it.

## Risk
1. Unmapped status codes will return '** Invalid **' without providing any usable information. This may result in incorrect data being displayed or used for other operations.
2. The function does not have any WHERE clause, although in this specific case, it is not necessary due to the nature of the function.

## Code Complexity
The function's code complexity is minimal, relying on a simple CASE statement for mapping input status codes to their respective descriptions.

## Refactoring Opportunities
One possible improvement could be to move the mapping of status codes and descriptions into a separate table, removing the hard-coded CASE statement from the function, and querying that table instead to return the matching description. This would simplify updates to the status codes and descriptions and allow for easier future expansion.
