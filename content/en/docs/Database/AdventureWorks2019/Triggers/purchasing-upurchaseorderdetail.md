## Overview

This trigger, `Purchasing.uPurchaseOrderDetail`, is designed to be executed on the `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail` table after any UPDATE operation. It performs several actions including inserting records into the `Production.TransactionHistory`, updating the `SubTotal` in the `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader` record, and updating `ModifiedDate` in the `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail` record.

## Details

1. **Trigger Name**: `Purchasing.uPurchaseOrderDetail`
2. **Triggered On**: `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail` table
3. **Trigger Event**: After any UPDATE operation

## Information on Data

This trigger operates on the `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail` table, which involves the following columns:

1. `ProductID`
2. `OrderQty`
3. `UnitPrice`
4. `PurchaseOrderID`
5. `PurchaseOrderDetailID`

## Information on the Tables

The trigger references the following tables:

1. `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail`
2. `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader`
3. `Production.TransactionHistory`
4. `dbo.uspPrintError`
5. `dbo.uspLogError`

## Possible Optimization Opportunities

None detected, as the trigger executes after an UPDATE operation and only does modifications when specific columns are updated.

## Possible Bugs

None detected, as the trigger has TRY...CATCH block implemented to handle errors gracefully.

## Risk

The risk section will include the query without a WHERE clause:

1. **Risk**: No risk detected as all the SELECT and UPDATE statements in this trigger have a WHERE clause.

## Code Complexity

This trigger's code complexity is moderate due to the combination of multiple conditional and transactional operations.

## Refactoring Opportunities

1. Consider breaking the trigger into smaller, more specific triggers for each action, such as inserting records into `Production.TransactionHistory` and updating related records in `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader` and `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail`.
2. Add comments to identify the steps and intended function of each code section to improve maintainability.

```sql
-- Insert records into TransactionHistory
-- (Explanation for the code section)

-- Update SubTotal in PurchaseOrderHeader record
-- (Explanation for the code section)

-- Update ModifiedDate in PurchaseOrderDetail record
-- (Explanation for the code section)
```

3. Utilize stored procedures to encapsulate the logic for inserting records, updating records, and managing transactions, which can improve code organization and reusability.
